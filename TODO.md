# User-Ops-Manager

Following items are plan for TODO: 

1. Basic User Operations (CRUD with Extended Functionality)
   - Core Functions: The API should provide typical CRUD operations—create, read, update, delete—but need to enhance these
    operation by adding features like:
     -  <s>Bulk Operations: Allow the API to handle bulk user creation, updates, or deletion with a single API call.
     - Soft Deletes: Implement soft deletes (where user data is flagged as deleted but not physically removed), allowing for
      easy recovery of users. 
     - Audit Logs: Every create/update/delete action can generate an audit trail for tracking changes in user data over
      time.</s>
2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Permissions Management - Will think if plan to add JWT and Other stuff
   - Role Management: Create roles and permissions for users (admin, manager, basic user) via API, and allow role
   assignments or restrictions.
   - Granular Permissions: Allow users to manage fine-grained access to specific data fields or API actions, which is
   crucial for secure multi-tenant applications.
   - API Keys/Token Management: Users can generate and manage API keys or OAuth2 tokens, enabling secure access to their
   own instances of the service.
3. Public API with Freemium Model
   - Free Tier: Offer basic user operations (CRUD, simple role management) for free.
   - Premium Tier: Offer advanced features like RBAC, auditing, and analytics for a premium tier, which can encourage
   adoption and growth.
   - Usage Analytics: Provide users with analytics on how their API is being used, e.g., requests per hour, most
   frequently used endpoints, etc.
4. User Insights & Reports
   - Data Insights: Provide insights based on user data—like how long users have been active, inactive user detection, and
   other user patterns (e.g., login frequency).
   - Scheduled Reports: Allow users to schedule and automatically receive reports about their user base, such as newly
   registered users, active users, churn rates, etc.
5. Customizable User Schema (Schema Flexibility)
   - Dynamic Fields: Give users flexibility to define custom fields for their user data (e.g., additional attributes
   like "department" or "customer type"), which allows them to extend the functionality based on their specific business
   needs.
   - Field Validation: Add validation rules (like regex patterns or min/max values) to custom fields for data integrity.
6. API Hooks/Extensions
   - Webhooks: Allow users to set up webhooks that notify their systems when certain events happen (e.g., a user is
   created, updated, or deleted).
   - Plugin System: Enable the API to be extended with plugins, where developers can add new functionalities like
   third-party authentication or integration with CRM systems.
7. Security Best Practices
   - Built-in Security Features: Implement OAuth2, JWT token authentication, and rate limiting as default security
   measures.
   - User Data Encryption: Ensure all sensitive data fields (passwords, emails, etc.) are encrypted, even in the database.
   - 2-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA for secure user authentication, and expose API endpoints for enabling or
   disabling this feature.
8. User Notification System
   - Notification Integration: Allow the API to integrate with notification services like email, SMS, or push
   notifications for user-related events (e.g., password reset, new user creation).
   - Customizable Notification Templates: Users can customize notification templates for different actions, such as
   welcome emails or account activation reminders.
9. Advanced Search & Filtering
   - Full-Text Search: Implement powerful search functionality allowing users to search for specific users based on
   various attributes (name, email, role).
   - Advanced Filtering: Enable users to filter their user base based on different attributes and even complex
   conditions (e.g., users created in the last 30 days, users who have admin roles, etc.).
10. API Documentation & SDKs
    - Comprehensive Documentation: Offer extensive documentation with examples, tutorials, and use cases that explain how
    to use every endpoint effectively.
    - SDKs & Libraries: Create SDKs in multiple programming languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.) to help developers
    integrate your API quickly and efficiently.
11. AI-Driven User Segmentation and Insights (Advanced Feature)
    - Machine Learning for Segmentation: Integrate machine learning to automatically segment users based on behavior or
    activity levels, and provide suggestions for user retention or targeted communication.
    - Predictive Analytics: Offer predictive insights on user behavior, such as likelihood of churn or user engagement
    trends, helping your users make data-driven decisions.
12. Rate Limiting and Usage Tiers
    - Rate Limits: Allow users to adjust rate limits or request different tiers of service for handling high traffic (
    especially important if they are running campaigns or expect spikes).
    - Throttling Options: Let users control throttling strategies for their APIs, like burst vs. steady rate limits.
13. Multi-Tenancy Support
    - Tenant Isolation: Ensure users can create isolated user groups and manage them independently in multi-tenant setups.
    This is ideal for businesses handling multiple client bases.
    - Sub-Accounts Management: Users can create sub-accounts for clients or departments and assign unique
    roles/permissions to them.
14. Versioned API with Deprecation Support
    - API Versioning: Version the API to ensure backward compatibility and allow users to upgrade to newer versions at
    their own pace.
    - Deprecation Warnings: Provide users with notices and suggestions when using deprecated endpoints, helping them
    migrate to new ones.
15. Rate Limiting and Caching Layer
    - Rate Limiting: Provide control over how many requests a user can send, with default settings to prevent abuse.
    - Caching for Efficiency: Introduce a cache layer for frequently queried data (like user profiles), reducing API load
    and improving response times.
